# pyGKV
Experimental Python bindings for gkv. [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/rudimk/pyGKV](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/rudimk/pyGKV?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

[Gkv](https://github.com/ybur-yug/gkv) happens to be a neat key-value store using Git. pyGKV is an experimental Python library for using gkv from within your Python modules.

## Internals

Nothing special, for now. pyGKV uses the [Rython](https://github.com/mjpizz/rython) library to create an XML-RPC interface to a Ruby interpreter. It also marshalls Ruby datatypes to Python types, and vice versa. Neat stuff, eh?

## Getting started

- Clone this repo, and install dependencies. Also make sure you've got gkv installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudimk/pyGKV.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
gem install gkv
```

- Import the library into your namespace.

```python
import pygkv
```

- Initialize a gkv store.

```python
db = pygkv.init_gkv()
```

- Now you're all set! 

```python
db.set("apples", 12)
db.set("oranges", 13)
db.get("apples")
db.all()
a = db.all()
a[0]["apples"]
# 12
```

## What's next?

I really like the idea of using Git as a KV. So I'm going to work on this. No, really.

- Better exception handling.
- PyPI package.
- Bindings for Javascript, maybe Julia(irrelevant here, but worth bragging about.)
